    "description": "**For user case 1:**\r\n\r\nWhen a user is performing a top-up via  [GET /transfer_info](http://docs.xfers.io/#get-transfer-info), they might forget to enter their contact number which is needed for our system to identify them.\r\n\r\nThe Intents API solves this issue by requiring the user to transfer a unique amount to Xfers which will be used to identify them. The difference between the  `unique_amount`  and the actual  `amount`  will be very small, and Xfers provides the difference for free to the user.\r\n\r\nNote that this only acts as a backup, and the user should enter his contact number in the comments section when doing a bank transfer whenever possible.\r\n\r\nExample: Jane wishes to transfer 5000 Indonesian Rupiah via  `/intents`.\r\n\r\n1.  She makes a HTTP GET request to  `/user/transfer_info`  to get the correct Xfers bank to transfer to (we have many banks!). The response tells her to transfer to Bank Central Asia (BCA).\r\n2.  She makes a HTTP POST request to create an intent. The response tells her to make a bank transfer of 4999 to Xfers.\r\n3.  Jane makes a transfer of 4999 to Xfers BCA. Within a few minutes, Xfers detects the transfer and tops up Jane’s Xfers account with 5000. Xfers absorbs the difference for free.\r\n4.  If  `notify_url`  is given, Xfers will send a callback to this url.\r\n\r\nNote the above scenario is only valid when disable_va is set to True\r\n\r\n**For user case 2:**\r\n\r\nIntent can also be use a means to get callback notifications from Xfers when a user successfully fund their virtual account on Xfers.\r\n\r\nExample: Jane wishes to transfer 5000 Indonesian Rupiah via  `/intents`  to her virtual Xfers account and get a callback notification when it successful\r\n\r\n1.  She makes a HTTP POST request to create an intent with disable_va set to false(default) and provide a  `notify_url`. The response will provide a list of virtual account nos she can fund her account with from a list of bank that Xfers support.\r\n2.  Jane makes a transfer of 500 to the Xfers BCA Virtual account that the intent api provide. Within a few minutes, Xfers detects the transfer and tops up Jane’s Xfers account with 5000.\r\n3.  Since  `notify_url`  is provided, Xfers will send a callback to this url."
